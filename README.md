# AWS Project Readme

## Project Overview
This repository contains all the resources and documentation for my AWS project. The project involves implementing various AWS services to achieve a specific goal.

## Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Utilize AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to define and manage infrastructure resources.

2. **Scalability:** Design and implement scalable solutions using AWS services like EC2 Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, and Lambda.

3. **High Availability:** Ensure high availability by deploying resources across multiple AWS Availability Zones.

4. **Security:** Implement best practices for securing AWS resources, including Identity and Access Management (IAM) and VPC configurations.

5. **Cost Optimization:** Monitor and optimize costs using AWS Cost Explorer and Budgets.

6. **Monitoring and Logging:** Set up CloudWatch for monitoring and CloudTrail for auditing AWS services.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `infra/`: Contains all infrastructure code (CloudFormation or Terraform templates).

- `app/`: Includes the application code and resources (e.g., web servers, databases).

- `scripts/`: Helpful scripts for automation and setup.

- `docs/`: Project documentation, including this `README.md` file.



## Usage
1. Modify the infrastructure and application code as needed for your specific project requirements.

2. Make sure to maintain proper version control for infrastructure code.

3. Monitor and optimize resources to control costs and ensure performance.
